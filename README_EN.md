# BG3 Race Compatibility Patch Generator

A MOD compatibility tool for Baldur's Gate 3, specifically designed to resolve compatibility issues between race MODs and appearance MODs.

## Development Notes

- This tool was developed on and off over several weeks, mainly because BG3's MOD format is quite complex, requiring parsing of LSX files and handling various edge cases.
- Initially wanted to write it in C#, but later found that Python's tkinter was simpler for UI development, so switched to Python. The code might not be the most elegant, but it works.
- Current functionality might not be perfect yet, feedback and suggestions are welcome.

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to the following open source libraries:

- **[LSLib](https://github.com/Norbyte/lslib)** - Powerful Larian Studios file format library that provides complete file format support

This library is the cornerstone of the entire BG3 MOD community, salute to the developers!
